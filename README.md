# js-ray-caster

A little ray casting engine in javascript. No libraries, no webGL.

Sprites/textures are based on the base asset from the [mini ludem dare #59](http://ludumdare.com/compo/minild-59/)

Thanks to [this great resource](http://www.permadi.com/tutorial/raycast/) for reference about old-school raycasting techniques.
